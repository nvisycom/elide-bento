"""STT wire contract, version 1.

Request carries base64-encoded audio bytes plus optional filename and language
hint; the response is a flat list of :class:`Segment`, each with millisecond
timings, text, and optional diarization speaker label, language, confidence,
and per-word breakdown.

The Rust client (``elide-bento``'s ``BentoStt``) is the source of truth; these
models mirror it. The wire is camelCase to match the client's serde
``rename_all = "camelCase"``.

**Timings are integer milliseconds**, not float seconds. Most engines (Whisper,
WhisperX, and every hosted API surveyed bar one) emit float seconds, so the
service converts at its boundary rather than leaking a second unit onto the
wire.
